- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which should be between 10x10px and 30x30px, though they don't need to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick a center color, which can be any color.
- For each input grid, make a square which is any size from 5x5px to 25x25px, or whatever will fit inside the input grid size. The square should have a transparent background and no border. The square must be odd in its width and height and must be positioned inside the input grid. Draw a random colored 1px square at three of the squares corners.
- For each output grid, copy the position, size, and color of the square and its three colored corners from the corresponding input grid. Then draw a 1px square at the center of the square in the center color picked above. Also, add 1px squares extending diagonally from the center to the corners that are colored. In 50% of puzzles, for all pairs, add just one square in each of the three directions. But for the other 50% of puzzles, add squares progressing outwards until they intersect with the corner. The diagonal 1px squares should be the same color as their corresponding corner.
