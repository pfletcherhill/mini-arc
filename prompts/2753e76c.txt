- For the puzzle, pick an output table direction (down, up, right, left). For the puzzle, also pick a table alignment, which can be left or right. You'll use these params for all pairs.
- Each input grid should be between 12x12px and 22x22px, though it doesn't have to be square
- For each input grid, pick 3-5 colors and for each color add 1-5 rectangles to the input grid. Each rectangle can be 2x2px to 4x4px, though it doesn't have to be square. Make sure that each color has a distinct number of rectangles in the grid. The rectangles should not overlap with any other rectangles and should have at least 1px gap between all rectangles.
- Each output grid should be sized according to the number of colors and the output table direction. If the output table direction is up or down, the output grid should have as many 1px rows as the input grid has colors. And it should be as wide in pixels as the most number of rectangles amonng any color in the input grid (ie if there are 2 red rectangles, 3 blue rectangles, and 5 green rectangles, then the output should be 5px wide). If the output table direction is left or right, the axes switch and the width is the number of colors and the height is the max number of rectangles in pixels.
- For each output grid, draw a 1px row (if direction is down/up) or column (if direction is right/left) for each color and make the row as wide as the number of rectangles in the corresponding input grid for that color. If the puzzle is left aligned, then align the rows of colors from the left extending to the right. If the puzzle is right aligned, align the rows on the right side and extend to the left. If the output direction is down, stack the rows from top to bottom sorted by the number of rectangles (from longest to shortest). If the direction is up, stack the rows from the bottom to the top of the output grid. If the direction is left, stack from the left to the right. And if the direction is right, stack from the right to the left.
