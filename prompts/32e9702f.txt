- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which can be 3x3px to 20x20px, though they don't have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick an input background color and an output background color. For every pair, make the background for the input grid the input background color and the background for the output grid the output background color.
- For the puzzle, pick an orientation (vertical or horizontal), direction (up, down, right, or left), and shift (1px, 2px, or 3px). These should apply to all pairs.
- For each input grid, add 1-5 lines based on the orientation for the puzzle. The lines should be 1px wide and between 3px and 8px long, though they should not be longer than the grid is wide or tall. The lines should not extend off the input grid. The lines should all be the same color for a given pair, which can be any color except either background color, though each pair can have its own line color.
- For each output grid, copy the lines position, shape, and color from the input grid and then shift their position based on the direction and shift picked above. All lines should be shifted by the same amount (1-3px) and its okay if a line is shifted partially off the output grid.
