- The goal of this puzzle is to recolor shapes based on the number of pieces they have, where each color corresponds to a number of pieces
- Pick a border color for the puzzle, which can be any color except black
- Pick a mapping between numbers 1-6 and random colors from the remaining colors
- For each pair, the input and output grids should have the same size, which should be between 10x10 px and 30x30 px, though does not have to be square.
- For each input grid, add 1-5 shapes, or as many will fit inside the grid without overlapping. Each shape should be a series of 1-6 touching rectangles with a transparent background and 1px border in the border color. Each of the rectangles in the shape should be overlapping by exactly 1px with at least one other rectangle in the shape. The rectangles should be between 3x3px and 5x5px in size, though they do not have to be square. There should be at least 1px in between all of the rectangles of the shape and any other rectangles or shapes in the input grid. And the rectangles should entirely fit inside the input grid, they should not extend beyond it.
- For each output grid, copy the size and position of the shapes from the corresponding input grid exactly. However, change the border color of each of the shapes based on the number of rectangles used to make it. If a shape is made up of 3 touching rectangles, then look up the color for the number 3 in the mapping above and turn the border for all rectangles in that shape in the output grid to that color.
