- For each pair, the input and output grids are the same size. The size of each pair of grids can range from 10x10px to 30x30px, though they don't have to be square.
- For each input grid, pick 2-5 random colors, which can be any color except the background color. Then randomly place a 1px square on the input grid for each color, ensuring that no two 1px squares share the same y-coordinate (ie they're all on different rows).
- For each output grid, draw a horizontal line across the output grid at the y-coordinate of each square in the input grid. The color of the line should correspond to the color of the square from the input grid. Then draw a 1px border on the top of the output grid with the color of the square in the input grid with the highest y-coordinate (ie the top-most square). Then draw a 1px border on the bottom of the output grid with the color of the square in the input grid with the lowest y-coordinate (ie the bottom-most square).
- For each output grid, then fill in the right and left edges of the grid with a 1px border pixel by pixel. The pixel colors should be determined by the lines drawn on the grid. If there is a line at y-coordinate 5 and another at y-coordinate 9, then the 4 pixels in between those two lines should be 2px for the top color and 2px for the bottom color. If the number of pixels in between two lines is odd, then the top color wins and gets the extra pixel. Using this algorithm, fill in the left and right borders of the output grid.
