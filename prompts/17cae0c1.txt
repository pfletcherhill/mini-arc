- For the puzzle, pick a unit shape, which can be between 2x2px and 4x4px, though it doesn't have to be square. Use the unit width and height for all pairs in the puzzle.
- For the puzzle, pick a input color, which can be any color except the background.
- For the puzzle, generate a mapping of unique patterns in the unit shape to colors. To generate each pattern, try filling the unit shape with random colored pixels. As long as the shape uses at least 1px and is unique, you can assign it one of the remaining colors. Repeat until you have a pattern for each of the colors.
- Each input grid should be 2-5x the unit width and 1-3x the unit height. So if the unit width is 3px, then an input grid can be 6px, 9px, 12px, or 15px wide. If the unit height is 3px, then an input grid can be 3px, 6px, or 9px tall. Each corresponding output grid should be the same size as its input grid.
- For each input grid, draw a series of random patterns from the pattern-to-color mapping in the input grid. If the input grid is 3 columns by 2 rows, then randomly pick 3 patterns and draw it in the input color in the top row of the input grid and another 3 random patterns for the second row.
- For each output grid, fill in each unit shape with the color that the pattern in the input grid corresponds to. so if your input grid is made up of two patterns of size 2x2px each, then your output grid should be two 2x2px rectangles in the color corresponding to the two unique patterns in the input grid.
