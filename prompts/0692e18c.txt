- Pick a number between 2-3 for the number of horizontal repeats and a number between 2-3 for the number of vertical repeats for all pairs in the puzzle. 
- For each pair, add an input grid with a size between 2x2 px and 5x5 px. The grid does not have to be square. Fill the input grid with a random pattern using a single color, except black.
- Then add an output grid for each pair, which is repeated version of the input grid. The pattern should be repeated horizontally and vertically based on the numbers picked above. However, instead of repeating the pattern exactly, repeat it by switching the colors. In the input grid, if a cell was colored, make it black. And if it was black, make it colored. Use the color from the input grid.
- When repeating the input grid, do not scale it up or down.
- No grid should be larger than 30x30 px.
