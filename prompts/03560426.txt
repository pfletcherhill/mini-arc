- For each pair, each input grid and output grid should be the same size. Each should be square between 10x10 px and 30x30 px.
- In each input grid, add up to 6 shapes along the bottom. Each shape should be 2-5px tall and 1-3px wide. They should be aligned to the bottom and have 1px in between them. All shapes should be entirely visible and should not extend beyond the grid. If a shape would extend beyond the grid, do not add it. The shape should have a random background color, except black.
- In each output grid, the shapes from the input grid should be repositioned. Starting from the left, align the first shape to the top left corner of the grid. Then align the second shape so that it's top left corner overlaps with the bottom right corner of the shape before it by 1px. Proceed with all the shapes, overlapping them with the shape before them by 1px.
