- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size. Each grid can be 12x12px to 30x30px, though they don't have to be square.
- For the whole puzzle, pick a random fill color, which can be any color except the background color
- For the whole puzzle, pick a rotation, which can be 0deg, 90deg, 180deg, or 270deg clockwise. All pairs will use this value.
- For each input grid, pick 3-4 colors that are any color except the background color or the fill color. Then make a rectangle with size 3x3px to 5x5px, though it doesn't have to be square. Inside this rectangle, draw a pattern using the 3-4 colors selected. You can leave some pixels transparent. You should try to organize it so that pixels of the same color are next to each other, though that's not a strict requirement. One idea would be fill the rectangle by randomly placing a pixel of each color at one point in the rectangle, then successivley placing another pixel of that color in a blank spot next to the first pixel of the same color, until 70-80% of the rectangle is full.
- For each input grid, once you've created a colored rectangle, make a second rectangle that is twice the height and twice the width of the colored rectangle. If the colored rectangle is 3x4px, then the second rectangle will be 6x8px. Inside the second rectangle, draw the same pattern as the colored rectangle, but scale the pattern up 2x so that each pixel in the first rectangle takes up 2x2px in the second. Instead of using the original colors, just use the fill color picked above. Then rotate the larger rectangle according to the rotation picked above.
- Then for each input grid, place both the colored rectangle and the rotated, larger rectangle in the grid so that they do not extend beyond the grid and do not touch or overlap each other.
- For each output grid, copy the rectangles from the input grid, but instead of using the fill color in the larger, rotated rectangle, use the colors from the colored rectangle. So both the input grid and the output grid should have exactly the same shape, size, and pattern, but the rectangles in the output grid should both be colored and in the input grid only the first rectangle should be colored and the second should use the fill color.
