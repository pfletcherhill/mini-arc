- For all pairs in the puzzle, pick five colors: (1) a background color (which should in 60% of cases be black), (2) an output color, (3) a divider color, (4) a top input color, and (5) a bottom input color
- For all pairs in the puzzle, also pick an algorithm type, which is either "OR" or "XOR"
- The background color for all grids should be the background color picked above
- For each output grid, pick a size between 4x4px and 12x12px, though it doesn't need to be square
- For each input grid, the width should be the same in pixels as the corresponding output grid, though its height should be 2x the output grid heigth + 1px
- In each input grid, draw a 1px horizontal divider line with the divider color picked above in the middle of the input grid, so it evenly splits the grid vertically. Then in the top half of the grid, add a random pattern using the top input color picked above. In the bottom half of the input grid, add another random pattern using the bottom input color picked above.
- For each output grid, fill in each pixel by pixel using this algorithm: for a pixel in the output grid, check if the pixel in the same position in the top input grid is colored and whether the pixel in the same position in the bottom input grid is colored. Then use the algorithm picked above for all the pairs to determine whether to leave the pixel in the output transparent or color it in with the output color. For example, if the algorithm is OR, then the given output pixel is transparent if either of the corresponding input pixels are colored (or if they're both colored) and the output color if neither of them is colored. If the algorithm is XOR, then the pixel is the output color if neither of the relevant pixels is colored or if they both are.
