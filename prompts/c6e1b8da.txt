- For all pairs, the input and output grids should be the same size, which is 16x16px to 22x22px, though they don't need to be square.
- For each input grid, add 3-5 colored rectangles to the grid, each should be 3x3px to 9x9px in size, though they don't need to be square. Each rectangle can be any color except the background color. The rectangles can overlap but none of the rectangles should fully be covered by other rectangles. Rectangles added later should have a higher z-index than rectangles added earlier. Then pick the last 1-3 rectangles that were added and draw a 1px line from the center of the rectangle in the same color as the rectangle in any direction (up, down, right, left, diagonal). The line should extend 1-5 pixels beyond the edge of the rectangle.
- For each output grid, add the same rectangles to the grid, including their position, shape, and color. Then for each of the rectangles with a line added in the input grid, move that rectangle in the direction of the line in the input grid. The number of pixels moved should be equivalent to the number of pixels extending beyond the edge of the rectangle in the input grid and the move should be in the same direction as the line.
