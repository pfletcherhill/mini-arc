- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size. Minimum grid size is 10x10 px and max is 30x30px, though they don't have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick a random path color, which is any color except the background color.
- Then for the puzzle, also pick 5 random colors, excluding the background color and path color, and store them as an orderedColors list. 
- For each input grid, place 2-5 1px squares in the input grid. The colors of the squares should be based on the orderedColors list. The first square should be the first color, the second square should be the second color, etc. None of the squares should have the same position.
- For each output grid, copy the size, position, and color of the squares added to the corresponding input grid. Then draw a 1px wide path in the path color from each square to the next square, using the order from the orderedColors list. Find the first square, which has the first color, and draw a path from that square to the second square, which has the second color. The path should only have one turn in it, and it should move horizontally and then vertically. Add paths between successive squares until you've come to the last square.
