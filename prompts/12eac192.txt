- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which is 3x3px to 20x20px, though doesn't have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick a fill color, which can be any color except the background color. Use this color in all the pairs.
- For the puzzle, also pick a cutoff number, which could be 2-4. You'll use this param in all the pairs.
- For each input grid, fill the grid with random pixels of 2-4 colors (excluding the background color and fill color). Some of the pixels should still be transparent and show the background color.
- For each output grid, first copy the shape, position, size, and color of the pixels from the input grid. Then calculate for each pixel the number of pixels of the same color, which it is connected to moving horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. For instance, if there are three red squares in a row, then each of those red squares has a number of 3. Once you have a number for each pixel, re-color the pixels that have a number below the cutoff defined below to the fill color. Keep all the pixels that are connected to the cutoff or more other pixels the same color as the input. Keep all the transparent pixels the same, regardless to how many other pixels they're connected to.
