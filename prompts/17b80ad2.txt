- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which should be 7x7px to 20x20px, though they don't have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick a base color, which can be any color except the background color. Use the base color in all pairs.
- For the puzzle, pick a direction which can be up, down, right, or left. Use the direction for all pairs.
- For each input grid, place 1-4 1px squares in the base color along the edge corresponding to the direction above. If the direction is up, use bottom edge. If the direction is down, use the top edge. If the direction is right, use the left edge. If the direction is left, use the right edge. Then add a bunch of random 1px squares in colors other than the background or base colors to the rest of the input grid.
- For each output grid, first copy the size, shape, position, and color of all the 1px squares in the input grid. Then draw lines starting from each of the 1px squares in the base color in the direction picked above. If the direction is right, from each of the 1px squares in the base color on the left edge, draw 1px squares right from that position until you hit a filled in square. Then keep drawing the same line in the same direction but using the color of the square you bumped into. Keep going using this pattern of drawing in the picked direction on the row or column picked by the base color squares until you reach the opposing edge.
