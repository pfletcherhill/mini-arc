- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which should be between 16x16px and 24x24px, though they don't have to be square.
- For each input grid, pick a border color and an interior color, which can be any colors except the background color. Then draw 1-3 rectangles with a 1px border in the border color and transparent background in the input grid. Each of the rectangles should not overlap or touch any of the other rectangles. Each rectangle should be 7px, 9px, or 11px in width and 8-10px in length. Some of the rectangles can be rotated 90%. Within each rectangle pick one side of the rectangle and draw a pattern using the interior color with 1px gap between the pattern and the rectangle border. Do not cross over the halfway point in the rectangle with the pattern.
- For each output grid, copy the position, shape, size, and color of the input grid contents first. Then fill in the other half of the interior of each rectangle by reflecting whatever pattern was drawn in the half in the input grid. The output grid shoudl have a symmetric pattern in the interior color in the inside of all rectangles.
