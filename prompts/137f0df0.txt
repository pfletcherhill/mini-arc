- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which should be 10x10px to 20x20px, though they don't have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick a box color, which can be any color except the background color. Also pick an inside color and an outside color. Use these colors for all pairs. 
- For the puzzle, pick a box size, which can be 2x2px to 3x3px, though it doesn't have to be square.
- For each input grid, pick a number of rows (2-4) and a number of columns (2-4) and draw rows and columns of boxes, where each box is the box color and size picked above. There should be a 1-3px gap in between each row and column, though the gap can change for each row or column. Do not add rows or columns that would extend beyond the edge of the input grid.
- For each output grid, copy the position, shape, and color of the boxes from the corresponding input grid. Then fill in the gaps in between all the rows and columns with the inside color from above. Finally, as if the filled in gaps were lines themselves, extend them to the edges of the grid using the outside color from above. As an example, if the input grid has four boxes (ie 2 columns and 2 rows), the gap in between them makes a cross. In the output grid, the cross in between the boxes would be the inside color and the part of the cross extending beyond the boxes and to the edges of the grid would be the outside color.
