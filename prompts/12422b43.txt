- For all pairs, the input grid and output grid should be the same size, which can be 5x5px to 20x20px, though doesn't have to be square.
- The high level goal of this puzzle will be extending a pattern from one side of the grid to another by repeating a marked portion of the pattern.
- For all pairs in the puzzle, pick a starting side (top, bottom, left, right) and also a marker color, which can be any color except the background color. Also pick a marker position, which can be left or right. All of these parameters (starting side and marker color) apply to all pairs, though they should be randomly set.
- For the purposes of the description below, I'm going to talk about the top as the starting side, but when the starting side is another side, imagine rotating all the instructions below to that side. So if I talk about the top left corner, then if the starting side is the left side, you should adjust that to be the bottom left corner.
- For each input grid, pick a column width (2-5px) and a column position, which is anywhere along the starting side as long as you leave a 1px for the marker position. If the marker position is left, then you have to leave at least 1px space on the left of the starting side for the marker to go. Make sure to adjust the column width based on the grid size. If your grid is only 5px wide, the max column width is then 4px.
- For each input grid, then fill in 3-6 rows of the column with random colors, except the background color or the marker color. For each row, fill in any number of pixels from 1px to the column width. And place the filled in pixels anywhere inside the row, as long as the filled in pixels overlap in x-position with at least one of the pixels in the row above.
- For each input grid, then pick a number of rows to repeat, which can be from 1 to 6 and starting from the top fill in that many pixels on the edge indicated by the marker position in the marker color. So if your column is 5 rows tall, your marker position is left, and you pick 3 to be your marker height, then draw 3px in the marker color from the top left corner of the grid vertically downward. That marker will indicate which rows of your column to repeat in the next step.
- For each output grid, first copy the pattern, shape, size, and color of the contents from the input grid to the output grid. Then you will complete the column in the output grid (ie add rows until you hit the bottom of the grid, or whatever the opposite of the starting side is) using the marked rows from the column. Repeatedly copy the rows from the column that are marked by the marker (ie top 3 rows if the marker height is 3) and add them to the column until the column touches the bottom of the output grid.
