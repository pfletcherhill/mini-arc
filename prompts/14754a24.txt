- For all pairs, the input and output grids should be the same size, which should be 12x12px to 24x24px, though they don't have to be square
- For the puzzle, pick three colors: (1) noise color, (2) shape color, and (3) highlight color. All of these should be distinct and different from the background color. Use them for all pairs.
- For the puzzle, pick a shape size 2x2px to 3x3px, though it doesn't have to be square. Then for that size, pick a shape by randomly picking pixels inside that shape to be filled. One example shape would be a cross in a 3x3px shape, where the middle vertical and horizontal pixels are filled. Use this pattern for all pairs.
- For each output grid, first generate a random pattern of pixels across the entire output grid using the noise color. About half of the pixels in the output grid should be colored in the noise color and the rest should be transparent.
- Then for each output grid, add 2-5 shapes using the shape size and pattern above in the shape color. They should not overlap with any other shapes. Finally, fill in some of the colored pixels in each shape with the highlight color.
- For each input grid, copy the noise pattern position, size, and color from the output grid exactly. Then for each of the shapes added to the output grid, copy their position, shape, and color to the input grid as well. However, for each of the shapes, replace pixels colored with the shape color with the noise color. Keep the pixels that are the highlight color the same.
