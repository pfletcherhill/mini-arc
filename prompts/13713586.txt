- For all pairs, the input and output grids are the same size, which is 12x12px and 24x24px, though does not have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick a base color, which can be any color except the background. Use the base color for all pairs.
- For each input grid, pick a base side (top, bottom, right, left) randomly and draw a 1px line along that edge. Then parallel to that edge, draw 2-5 lines in any color elsewhere in the grid. Each of these lines should be parallel to the base and should each be 2-8px in length and should not overlap with any other lines.
- For each output grid, copy the base shape, position, and color from the input grid to the output grid. Then for each of the lines drawn in the input grid, extend that lines to be a rectangle that starts where the line originally was and extends to the baseline. The color of the rectangle should be the same as the color of the line in the input. Rectangles should be drawn from farthest away from the baseline to closest so that the rectangles that are shorter (ie closer to the baseline) are "in front" of the rectangles drawn farther away.
- As a variation, you can make the baseline 1-3px in size, though all pairs should have the same width baseline.
