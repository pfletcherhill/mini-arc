- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size. For each pair, the grids should be between 10x10 px and 20x20 px and should be square.
- For the whole puzzle, pick a starting color, which can be any color except black.
- For each pair, pick two more colors, excluding black and the starting color.
- For each input grid, make the two top left pixels the two picked colors. Then place a 1px dot a random location on the input grid, as long as its 2x away from any of the edges.
- For each output grid, first copy the starting dot from the input grid, both its location and color. Then draw lines in increasing length in a spiral pattern around the dot. All lines should be 1px in width. The first line should start from the starting dot and be of length 2px and go left. The next line should start from the end of the previous line and be 3px and go down. The next line should be 4px and go right. And the next line should be 5px and go up. The lines should proceed in this pattern until a line would go off the grid. The color of the lines should alternate from the colors in the top left of the input grid. If the top let of the input had red and green, then the first line would be red, the second green, the third red, etc. 
- Each puzzle should randomly pick a corner to have the two line colors for all pairs. And each puzzle should also randomly decide whether the spiral proceeds clockwise or counter-clockwise, as long as the direction is the same for all grids.
