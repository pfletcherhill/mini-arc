- For each pair, re-size the grids. Both the input and output grids should be the same size, 10x10 px up to the size of the container. They don't have to be square. The size of the grids should also be determined randomly with each page load.
- Pick a border color for all pairs.
- Define a random mapping between square sizes and colors. The square sizes should be 5px, 7px, 9px, 11px, etc. The colors should exclude the border color defined above and black.
- For each pair, add 1-5 squares to the input grid. Each square should have a 1px dot in its center and a 1px wide border. The dot and the border should be the border color. The squares should have a transparent background. The squares should be placed randomly throughout the input grid, but they cannot overlap with each other and they must stay within the grid. No part of the square, including its border, should go outside the bounds of the grid it is in or overlap with any other square. Each square must be at least 5x5 px in size, including the 1px border, and be odd in size so that the dot can always be centered (ie 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, etc).
- Then update the output grid for each pair. For each output grid, copy the exact same squares from the input grid to the output grid. They should be the same size and position. However, the background color for each square should be changed based on its size. Use the mapping from sizes to colors above to change the background color. Everything else should stay the same. The same mapping should be used on all pairs in the document.
