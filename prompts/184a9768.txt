- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which should be between 16x16px and 26x26px, though they don't have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick a noise color, which can be any color except the background color. Use the noise color in all pairs.
- For each pair, we'll start by describing the output grid and then the input grid.
- For each output grid, add 1-2 rectangles, each 7x7px to 11x11px in size, though they don't have to be square. Each rectangle should have a color, that is any color except the background color. On top of each rectangle, add 2-5 smaller rectangles that are each 1x1px to 5x5px, though most should not be square. None of the larger rectangles should overlap or touch, and for a given larger rectangle, none of the smaller rectangles should overlap with each other.
- For each input grid, copy the size, position, shape, and color of the larger rectangles. Add the same smaller rectangles on top with the same shape and position, but their color should be the background color of the grid instead of their color in the output grid. Then add all of the small rectangles from the output grid to the input grid but make sure they do not overlap with any other rectangles and are not on top of any of the larger rectangles. Finally, in the input grid, add 2-10 extra 1px squares to the grid in the noise color. Make sure these squares do not overlap any other rectangles.
