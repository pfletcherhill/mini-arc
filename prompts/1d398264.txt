- For each pair, the input and output grids must be the same size, which is 10x10px to 22x22px, though they don't have to be square
- For each input grid, draw a 3x3px square, where each of the 9 pixels is a random color (any color except the background color). It's okay for colors to repeat. Place the 3x3px square anywhere in the input grid, as long as it doesn't extend beyond the grid.
- For each output grid, first copy the 3x3px square position, shape, and color from the input grid. Then in the output grid, draw 8 lines pixel by pixel extending from each of the square's border pixels to the edge of the output grid. Each line should be in the color of the corresponding border pixel. For instance, if the top left pixel in the 3x3px square is yellow, then draw 1px yellow squares moving 1px up and 1px left with each step until you reach the edge of the output grid. For the left middle pixel, extend the line 1px square at a time straight left.
