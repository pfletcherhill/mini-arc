- For the puzzle, pick an output color and a divider color, which can be any colors except the background color. Use these colors for all pairs.
- For each input grid, pick a rectangle size, which can be from 4x4px to 8x8px, though doesn't have to be square. The input grid should be twice the width of this rectangle + 1px and the same height as the rectangle. Draw a 1px divider down the center of the input grid in the divider color, then on the left side draw a random pattern pixel by pixel in a random color (anything except the divider and output color) and on the right side draw a random pattern pixel by pixel in another random color (anything except the divider and output color).
- Each output grid should be the size of the rectangle in the corresponding input grid. To fill in each output grid, go pixel by pixel. For a given pixel in the output grid, if either or both of the pixels in the same position in the rectangles in the input grid are colored in, then color the pixel the output color, otherwise leave it transparent.
