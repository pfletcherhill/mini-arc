- For each pair, the input and output grids should be the same size, which is 12x12px to 20x20px, though they don't have to be square.
- For the puzzle, pick an inside color and an outside color, which should be distinct and not the background color. Use these colors for all pairs.
- For each input grid, draw 2-4 shapes. Each shape should have a 1px border and transparent background. Each shape should not necessarily be rectangle but can be from 3x3px in size up to 10x10px in size. Make each shape by overlapping multiple rectangles within the dimensions of the shape and then drawing a 1px border around the edges of the overlapping boxes. The border color for the shape can be any color except the background color or the inside or outside colors picked above.
- For each output grid, copy the shape and position of the shapes drawn in the input grid. Copy the same border and color for the shape, though along the border, recolor pixel-by-pixel the corners of the border. If the corner is facing the interior of the shape, color it the inside color. If the corner is facing the outside of the shape, color it the outside color. Any pixels along the border that are not corners should stay the same color.
