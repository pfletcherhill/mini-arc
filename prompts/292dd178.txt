- For each pair, the input and output grid should be the same size, which should be between 9x9px and 20x20px, though it doesn't have to be square.
- For each pair, pick a background color. Apply the background color to both the input and output grids for that pair.
- For the puzzle, pick a border color and a fill color. These colors will be used for all pairs. These colors should be different and can be any color except the background color.
- For each input grid, draw 2-4 rectangles, which can be between 4x4px and 6x6px in size, though they don't have to be square. Rectangles should not touch or overlap with any other rectangles. When placing rectangles, do not place a rectangle if it would touch or overlap with another rectangle. The rectangles should have transparent fill and a 1px border in the border color.
- For each rectangle in each input grid, pick a random pixel on the border and fill it with the background color, so it looks transparent. The pixel should be along one of the sides and not be one of the corner pixels.
- For each output grid, copy the rectangles position, size, and color from the input grid. Then fill the rectangles with the fill color and then extend the 1px added to the rectangle in the input grid to the edge of the grid. If a rectangle had a random pixel on the right side, then fill in that pixel with the fill color and then draw a 1px line from that pixel to the right edge also in the fill color.
- Ideally, the pixels should be picked in the input grid so that the lines in the output grid will not intersect with any other rectangles. However, if the lines intersect with any other rectangles, make sure that they go underneath the rectangles and not over them.
