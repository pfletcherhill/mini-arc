- For each pair, the grids should be the same size, which should be between 10x10px and 30x30px, though they don't have to be square
- For each pair, pick a line color and a rectangle color. These can be any color except the background color.
- For each input grid, place 4-15 rectangles in the grid. Each rectangle should be 2x2px to 10x10px in size, though they do not have to be square. Rectangles are not allowed to overlap each other and must have at least a 1px gap in between all rectangles. The rectangles should be the rectangle color picked for that pair.
- Then for each input grid, pick 0-3 horizontal line positions and 0-3 vertical line positions. Each of the horizontal line positions should be a point along the y-axis of the input grid, and each of the vertical line positions should be a point along the x-axis of the input grid. For each of the horizontal line positions, add a 1px square in the line color for the pair on both the left edge of the grid and the right edge of the grid at that position. For each of the vertical line positions, add a 1px square in the line color for the pair on both the top edge of the grid and the bottom edge of the grid at that position. For either the horizontal or vertical line positions, if there is a rectangle already in the position you would place either of the 1px squares, do not place either square and proceed to the next position. 
- For each output grid, copy the shape, size, color, and position of all of the rectangles from the input grid and add them to the output grid. For each of the horizontal and vertical line positions from the input grid, draw a 1px line fully across the grid at that position on its respective axis. As you draw each of the horizontal and vertical lines, check whether each pixel intersects with a rectangle in the grid. If so, change the color of that rectangle to the line color.
