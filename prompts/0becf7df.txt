- Input grids and output grids should be the same size, which should be 10x10 px to 30x30px, though they don't have to be square.
- Pick background color, make all the grids that background color, though in 60% of puzzles the background color should be black
- Set a true/false param for the puzzle called showOutputKey which in 50% of the cases is true and 50% is false
- For each pair, pick 4 colors that are any colors except the background color. Record the order of these colors.
- For each pair, pick a corner and add a 2x2px square to that corner to the input grid and the output grid, if the showOutputKey param is true for the puzzle. The square should have a pixel in each of the colors picked above for the pair, with the first two colors on the top row and the second two colors on the second row.
- For each input grid, place a rectangle between 4x4px to 14x14px, or whatever will fit in the grid without overlapping with the square already added and maintaining at least a 1px gap with the edge of the input grid. Inside this rectangle, draw a pattern using the 4 colors selected for the pair. You can leave some pixels transparent. You should try to organize it so that pixels of the same color are next to each other, though that's not a strict requirement.
- For each output grid, copy the size, shape, position, and color of the rectangle from the input grid exaftly. Then change the colors of the pixels inside the rectangle according to the order of the four colors picked for the pair. Pixels that were the first color, should be changed to the second color. Pixels that were the second color should become the first color. Pixels that were the third color should become the fourth color, and pixels that were the fourth color should become the third color.
